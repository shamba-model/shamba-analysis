    """Draw a single scalar perturbation from the distribution described by spec.

    The return value is an absolute draw in the same units as the base value,
    scaled to the supplied base_mean. The caller is responsible for how the
    draw is applied: climate keys use it to derive a multiplicative ratio;
    non-climate vector parameters call this once per element using each
    element's own value as base_mean, so that the spread scales with the
    local value rather than the vector mean.

    Edge cases
    ----------
    base_mean == 0:
        Relative spread (CV-based) is undefined when the mean is zero. For
        distributions that scale spread as ``base_mean * spread_lower``, the
        effective std collapses to zero regardless of the spread parameter.
        If ``min_abs`` is supplied it still applies, giving a non-zero floor.
        If not, the draw returns ``base_mean`` (i.e. 0) deterministically.
        ``distribution_handler`` warns when a zero base value is paired with
        no ``min_abs``, so this path should rarely be reached silently.

    effective_std == 0 (lognormal):
        ``scipy.stats.lognorm`` with ``scale=0`` is degenerate and raises an
        error. We short-circuit and return ``base_mean`` instead. This also
        avoids a division-by-zero when computing ``effective_sigma = std / mean``.

    truncated_normal near zero:
        The lower bound is expressed in standardised units as
        ``a = -base_mean / effective_std``. When ``base_mean`` is large relative
        to ``effective_std``, ``a`` is a large negative number and truncation has
        negligible effect. When ``base_mean`` is small (close to zero), ``a``
        approaches 0, the left tail is heavily truncated, and the resulting
        distribution is visibly right-skewed even though the spec is symmetric.
        This asymmetry is a physical consequence of the non-negativity constraint,
        not a bug.
