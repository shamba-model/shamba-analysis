    RothCParams' role for the RothC model.

    Defaults match the values previously hardcoded in roth_c.py, forward_roth_c.py,

    numerically equivalent to floating-point precision. The moisture RMF floor is
    deliberately derived as (1 - moisture_b_slope) rather than stored as its own
    field, since floor and slope describe the same linear interpolation and must
    stay coupled under future perturbation (see get_rmf() in roth_c.py) — this
    introduces a single last-bit (~1e-16 relative) rounding difference from the
    prior hardcoded 0.2, well below the model's own numeric tolerances. Exists so
    these constants can be overridden per call (e.g. by Monte Carlo sampling)
    instead of being fixed at import time.
